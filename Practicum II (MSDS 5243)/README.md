### Abstract:

Wildfire size, frequency, severity, and associated fatalities have surged at an alarming rate over the past 25 years, resulting in steep budget increases. According to USDA, the annual budget of U.S. Forest Service devoted to wildfires had more than tripled, jumping from 16% to 52% between 1995 and 2015 and it exceeded $2 billion in 2017. Under the current budget and capacity constraints, allocating correct amount of personnel and equipment to a fire timely is vital in suppresing fire, reducing costs, and saving lives. In this paper, we use gradient boosting decision trees to predict the number of personnel needed to effectively fight a wildfire. By combining the US wildland fire incident data and weather data, our model obtained a coefficient of determination (R2) 77.78%, a significant improvement over historical solution. Our model can potentially be used to provide decision support for those units who fight wildfires.
