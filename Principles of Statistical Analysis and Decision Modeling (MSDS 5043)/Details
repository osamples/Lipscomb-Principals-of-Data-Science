Lipscomb University Masters of Science in Data Science

  Principles of Statistical Analysis and Decision Modeling (MSDS 5043)
  
    Course Description:
      This course covered basic statistic concepts including sampling distribution,
      inference, sample size, linear regression, ANOVA. It was a highly practical class
      that focused on R tools for learning from data. I learned a lot of R on managing,
      summarizing and visualizing data, building models and making prediction. I used
      R Studio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform research
      or report in a replicable way.
