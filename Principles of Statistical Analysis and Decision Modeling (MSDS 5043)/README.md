# Lipscomb University Masters of Science in Data Science

## Principles of Statistical Analysis and Decision Modeling (MSDS 5043)

### Course Description:
  This course covered basic statistic concepts including sampling distribution,
  inference, sample size, linear regression, ANOVA. It was a highly practical class
  that focused on R tools for learning from data. I learned a lot of R on managing,
  summarizing and visualizing data, building models and making prediction. I used
  R Studio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform research
  or report in a replicable way. 

### Deliverables:
  - HW1: Exploring the Data with R
  - HW2: Distribution of Random Variables 
  - HW3: Foundation of Inference
  - HW4: Inference for Proportion
  - HW5: Inference for Means
  - HW6: Inference for Linear Models
  - HW7: Inference for Analysis of ANOVA
  - FA: Demonstration of the Above
