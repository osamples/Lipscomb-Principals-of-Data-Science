# Lipscomb University Masters of Science in Data Science

## Data Mining and Analysis (MSDS 5163)

### Course Description:
Computational techniques for analysis of large, complex data sets, covering fundamental aspects as
well as modern data mining and analysis techniques. Hands-on experience with data mining software. 
A formal discussion and overview of the dual view of linear algebra and multivariate statistics is 
to be presented. Most of the course code examples are in R and python. Additional topics may include
selections from the following: distributed computing, high-performance computing, scientific computing
methods, Hadoop, structured and unstructured data sources and methods, supervised and un-supervised 
machine learning, dimensional reduction, correlation, singular value decomposition, linear and logistic
regression models, Bayesian inference, distance and similarity measurements and computation in distributed
data, review of matrix algebra and basic statistical methods in high dimensions.
