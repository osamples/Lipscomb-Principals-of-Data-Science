# Lipscomb University Masters of Science in Data Science

## Information Structures (MSDS 5023)

### Course Description:

This course was about the day-to-day reality of the working data scientist. You may not get to 
create a high dimension neural network every day, but you do have to find, cleanse, shape, display, 
and otherwise muck about in data. Data rarely starts out pretty, but the work to get it so is 
rewarding and well worth the effort.

### Goals:
- Develop a mastery of the fundamental concepts, problems, principles, techniques, and issues 
- Understand effective organization of resources is a necessary condition for utilizing resources â€“ 
  particularly exploratory visualization
- Skilled in the use of a range of (general) techniques and (specific) software tools for the
  storage, description, categorization, linking, and discovery of resources
- Familiar with the nature and purpose of a range of standard schemata, frameworks, languages, 
  vocabularies, formats, models, and rule-sets
- Have knowledge of appropriate criteria on which to base choices among available approaches, 
  techniques, tools, and standards


### Deliverables:
- acfootball_ocs.ipynb : Example of Web Scraping Skills and Data Wrangling
- re_ocs.ipynb : Example of Regular Expression Manipulation
