# Lipscomb University Masters of Science in Data Science

## Research Methods (MSDS 5053) and Practicum I (MSDS 5143)
  
### Course Description:
  Students engaged in a literature search, explored questions that can be solved with data science methods, composed
  a scientific research paper, and deceloped a background in academic writing to prepare them for the Practicum. 
  Students also explored the research process investigating information needs, creation, organization, flow, retrieval
  and use. Stages include: research definition, question, objectives, data collection and management, data analysis 
  and data interpretation. 

### Goals and Objectives:
  The major goal of this course was to address the complex and unique issues related to producing qualit research
  findings.

### Deliverables:
  - Project Proposal for Practicum II (Final Paper, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Presentation)
       Abstract— Wildfire size, frequency, severity, and associated fatalities have upsurged at an alarming rate
       over the past 25 years, resulting in steep budget increases. A model that predicts the optimal number of
       personnel needed for fire suppression would significantly trim this firefighting budget, allowing for the
       focus to be redirected to land management and preventative efforts. By utilizing a unique dataset of 125,367
       US wildland fire incidents recorded within a five year span, we propose a real-time model that will predict
       the optimal number of personnel needed to effectively fight fires. Our project is designed to increase 
       efficiency and help lower the cost of the US Department of Agriculture’s rapidly growing firefighting budget
       through accurate forecasting of personnel needs dependent on understanding the impact of regional differences,
       wet and dry seasons, and preventative methods on fire frequency.
